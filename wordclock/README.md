# Word Clock
This is an ESP controlled word clock based on a few different open source projects. I'm including the custom source code here, while the laser cut files and assembly instructions are available elsewhere

The source is based off of https://github.com/leinich/ha-wordclock-esphome

The clock face and design is based off of 

# To Do:
- ~~add a color selection option through HASS to control clock face color~~
- save the recent color and use it on boot?
- ~~fix the minutes~~
- add the happy birthday lettering
- create input boolean from HASS to trigger the lettering or turn it off
- add some flair to the text when it turns to the hour
