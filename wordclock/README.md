# Word Clock
This is an ESP controlled word clock based on a few different open source projects. I'm including the custom source code here, while the laser cut files and assembly instructions are available elsewhere

# To Do:
- add a color selection option through HASS to control clock face color
- save the recent color and use it on boot?
- fix the minutes
